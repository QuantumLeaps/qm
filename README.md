# About QM
QM (QP Modeler) is a freeware graphical modeling tool for designing and
implementing real-time embedded software based on the UML state machines
and the lightweight QP active object frameworks. QM is available for
Windows 32/64-bit, Linux 64-bit, and MacOS.

> NOTE: For more information, please refer to the online QM Manual at:
https://state-machine.com/qm/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Installing QM on Windows (32/64-bit)

> CAUTION: If you have any previous version of QM installed on your
system, please *uninstall* it before installing the new version.

Download the QM installer for Windows, which is a Windows executable.
Run the installer. The installation is very straightforward and offers
you options of installing a desktop icon and associate QM model files
(*.qm) with the QM tool. The uninstaller is provided.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Installing QM on Linux (64-bit)

> CAUTION: If you have any previous version of QM installed on your
system, please *uninstall* it before installing the new version.

Download the QM installer for Linux. You need to make the file
executable in order to run it. You can either do this  with your
desktop's file manager or at the command line, type:

```sh
chmod u+x qm_4.0.0-linux64
```

You should now be able to execute the installer. You can do this from
your file manager (by double-clicking on the installer), or from the
command line by typing:

```sh
./qm_4.0.0-linux64
```

Run the installer. The uninstaller is provided.

> NOTE: To run the QM application on Linux, you need to run the <qm
installation dir>/bin/qm.sh script. Make sure that the file has
executable permissions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Installing QM on MacOS

> CAUTION: If you have any previous version of QM installed on your
system, please *uninstall* it before installing the new version.

Double click on the provided qm_4.0.0-macos.dmg file. This will mount
and open the disk image. To install the QM tool, you simply drag the
qm.app image into the Applications folder (typically visible in the
Dock). If you wish, you might also create the alias of the qm.app and
place it on your Desktop.

To uninstall QM, simply delete the qm.app file and the examples.

> NOTE: The QM application contains both the QM GUI and the QMC model
compiler command-line utility. You can invoke the QMC utility from the
terminal by typing:

```sh
/Applications/qm.app/Contents/MacOS/qmc
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXAMPLE PROJECTS
The QM example models are included in the QP baseline distributions. The
console-type examples are available for Windows (MinGW and Visual C++),
Linux, and macOS. GUI-based simulations are available for Windows with the
raw Win32 API. Cross-platform GUI examples based on the Qt framework are
available in QP/C++.

Embedded examples are available for a number of boards, such as ARM
Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430 with the IAR, ARM/KEIL, and GNU compilers.

Additionally, a number of examples are provided for the desktop (Windows
and POSIX). These examples don't require any embedded hardware to try.

All examples are located in the <qp>/examples/ directory, where <qp>
denotes the folder where you have installed the specific version of the
QP framework (QP/C, QP/C++, or QP-nano).

free use, but is not open source. During the installation you will need
to accept a basic End-User License Agreement (see
https://state-machine.com/qm/LICENSE-QM.txt ), which legally protects

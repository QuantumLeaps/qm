QUANTUM LEAPS QM (QP MODELER)
MODEL-BASED DESIGN AND CODE GENERATING SOFTWARE
END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

These license terms are an agreement between Quantum Leaps and you.
Please read them. They apply to the QM model-based design tool as well
as to any accompanying documentation and examples.

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT
THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 QM (QP Modeler) is a freeware model-based design (MBD) and automatic
code generation tool for real-time embedded software in C or C++ based on
hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts) and the event-driven
QP Real-Time Embedded Frameworks (RTEFs). QM is available for Windows,
Linux, and MacOS hosts.

1.2 QP (Quantum Platform) is a family of lightweight Real-Time Embedded
Frameworks (RTEFs) for building reactive embedded software as systems of
asynchronous event-driven active objects (actors). The QP family consists
of QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality
controlled, thoroughly documented, and available in full source code.

The behavior of active objects is specified in QP by means of hierarchical
state machines (UML statecharts). The QP frameworks support manual coding
of UML state machines in C or C++ as well as Model-Based Design (MBD) and
automatic code generation by means of the free QM Model-Based Design tool.
The QP framework familiy has been described in the book "Practical UML
Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition" by Miro Samek, (ISBN: 978-0750687065).

1.3 "Qt Toolkit" is a cross-platform application and UI framework. The
Qt Toolkit is Copyright (C) Qt Group (Nasdaq Helsinki: QTCOM) and/or its
subsidiary(-ies) and other contributors. Qt Toolkit can be used under the
Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL v3), (see:
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/lgpl.html).

1.4 "Licensed Software" means the QM executable, documentation, and
example models. The Licensed Software expressly does NOT include the
source code generated by the QM code generator, which is licensed under
the same terms as the underlying QP framework(s).

1.5 "Quantum Leaps Core Market" means the market for event-driven
real-time embedded frameworks as well as graphical state machine
model-based design and code generating software.

The Licensed Software uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL.
The Licensed Software complies with the LGPL in the following ways:

5.1 The Licensed Software dynamically links to the unmodified Qt
Framework, as provided by the Qt Project (see
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/lgpl.html) in the pre-compiled binary format.

5.2 All users of the Licensed Software are expressly allowed to use
their own versions of the Qt Toolkit libraries as long as they remain
interface-compatible with the libraries originally used to build the
Licensed Software.

5.3 Every installation of the Licensed Software contains the "qt_lgpl"
folder with the copy of the Qt licenses, including the LGPL v2.1, as
well as the file index.html, which describes how to download, install,
and bulid the Qt Toolkit dynamically linked libraries in the exact
version used by the Licensed Software.

5.4 The source code distributions of Qt Toolkit used in the Licensed
Software are provided on the Quantum Leaps website, where they are
guaranteed to be available for at least three (3) years after the
original release date of the Licensed Software.

5.5 The "about box" of the QM application prominently states that this
program uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL v2.1. Also the QM
Manual prominently states that this program uses the Qt Toolkit under
the terms of LGPL v2.1.

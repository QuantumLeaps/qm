Compliance with Qt LGPL
========================
The QM Modeling Tool uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License v. 3 and the GNU Lesser General Public License v. 2.1
(both jointly "LGPL"). In compliance with LGPL, this document collects the
relevant information about downloading, installing, and building the Qt
Toolkit from sources. The main source of the information and most of the web
links provided here come from the Qt Company's website.

LGPL License Text
=================
The first step in compliance with LGPL is that every recipient of the QM
software receives also the full text of the LGPL licenses used. QM complies
with this requirement by including the full text of the LGPL licenses
in every QM distribution (folder qt_lgpl, files lgpl-2.1.txt and lgpl-3.txt).


How QM Modeling Tool Uses Qt
============================
Dynamic Linking
---------------
On each supported platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS), the QM™ Modeling Tool
*dynamically* links to the unmodified Qt libraries, as provided by the Qt
Company in the pre-compiled binary format.

LGPL Information in QM GUI
--------------------------
Also, in compliance with LGPL, the "About QM" dialog box of the QM
application prominently states that this program uses the Qt Toolkit under
the terms of LGPL.

Qt Version Information
----------------------
Additionally, the QM Help Menu includes the standard "About Qt" dialog box,
which informs the user about the exact version of Qt and explains the Qt
licensing terms. Finally, the QM Manual prominently states that this program
uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL.

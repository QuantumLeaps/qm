<div class="textblock"><h1>QUANTUM LEAPS QM&trade; (QP&trade; MODELER)<br  />
 GRAPHICAL MODEL-BASED DESIGN AND CODE GENERATING SOFTWARE<br  />
 END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</h1>
<p >These license terms are an agreement between Quantum Leaps and you. Please read them. They apply to the QM graphical modeling tool as well as to any accompanying documentation and examples. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. </p>
<h2>1. DEFINITIONS</h2>
<p >1.1. <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qm">QM&trade; (QP Modeler)</a> is a graphical model-based design and code generating tool for event-driven software. QM provides intuitive diagramming environment for hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts) and generates compact, production quality C/C++ code based on the QP real-time embedded frameworks. QM itself is based on the cross-platform Qt Toolkit, which is used inside QM under the terms of LGPL (see Section 1.3 "Qt Toolkit"). QM is currently available for Windows, Linux and MacOS hosts. </p>
<p >1.2. QP&trade; (Quantum Platform) is a family of lightweight real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs) for building responsive and modular real-time embedded applications as systems of cooperating, event-driven active objects (actors). The QP&trade; family consists of <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpc">QP/C</a>, <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpcpp">QP/C++</a>, and <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpn">QP-nano</a> frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, thoroughly documented, and dual-licensed under the GPL and traditional closed-source commercial licenses. The QP frameworks have been described in the book <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/psicc2/">Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition</a> by Miro Samek, (ISBN: 978-0750687065). </p>
<p >1.3. <a href="http://www.qt.io" class="extern" target="_blank">Qt Toolkit</a> is a cross-platform application and UI framework. The Qt Toolkit is Copyright by <a href="http://www.qt.io" class="extern" target="_blank">Qt Company</a> and/or its subsidiary(-ies) and other contributors. Qt Toolkit can be used under the GNU Lesser General Public License v. 2.1 and the GNU Lesser General Public License v. 3 (both jointly <a href="https://www.qt.io/qt-licensing-terms/" class="extern" target="_blank">"LGPL"</a>). </p>
<p >1.4. "Licensed Software" means the QM executable, documentation, and example models. The Licensed Software expressly does NOT include the source code generated by the QM code generator, which is licensed under the same terms as the underlying QP framework(s). </p>
<p >1.5 "Quantum Leaps Core Market" means the market for real-time, event-driven real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs) as well as graphical state machine modeling and code generating software. </p>
<h2>2. GRANT OF COPYRIGHT LICENSE</h2>
<p >Quantum Leaps grants to you, and you hereby accept, a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to do the following: </p>
<p >2.1. to install and use the Licensed Software for the purpose of designing, developing, documenting, testing, and demonstrating your programs; and </p>
<p >2.2. to create QM models. Any models that you create by QM shall be your Intellectual Property, subject to any rights Quantum Leaps may have in the underlying software, such as the QP frameworks, pursuant to the following Section 3 hereof ("EXCLUSIONS FROM LICENSE GRANT"). </p>
<h2>3. EXCLUSIONS FROM LICENSE GRANT</h2>
<p >The Licensed Software is licensed by this Agreement, not sold or given away. This Agreement only grants you some rights to use the software. Quantum Leaps reserves all other rights. </p>
<p >3.1. No right is granted to the code generated by the QM code generator, which is licensed under the same terms as the underlying QP framework(s). The QP frameworks are <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/licensing">licensed</a> independently and separately from this Agreement. </p>
<p >3.2. No right is granted to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other Intellectual Property of Quantum Leaps, even if such trademarks are included in the Licensed Software. </p>
<p >3.3. No right is granted to the Qt Toolkit, which is copyright by <a href="http://www.qt.io" class="extern" target="_blank">The Qt Company</a> and/or its subsidiary(-ies) and other contributors and is used by the Licensed Software under the LGPL open source license (see Section 5 "Compliance with LGPL"). </p>
<p >3.4. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit Quantum Leaps from licensing under different terms from this Agreement any original work that Quantum Leaps otherwise would have a right to license. </p>
<h2>4. LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE</h2>
<p >You may use the Licensed Software only as expressly permitted in this Agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. By accepting this Agreement you agree to the following: </p>
<p >4.1. You may not remove or modify any copyright notes, legal notes, license information, attribution notes, logos, URLs, or e-mail addresses embedded in the source code generated by QM, or in the QM executable and in the QM documentation; </p>
<p >4.2. You may not sell, rent, lease or lend the Licensed Software; and </p>
<p >4.3. You may not use the Licensed Software to create similar stand-alone products within Quantum Leaps' Core Market. </p>
<h2>5. COMPLIANCE WITH LGPL</h2>
<p >The Licensed Software uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL. The Licensed Software complies with LGPL in the following ways (see also <a class="el" href="qt_lgpl.html">Compliance with Qt LGPL</a>): </p>
<p >5.1. The Licensed Software dynamically links to the unmodified Qt Toolkit, as provided by the Qt Project in the pre-compiled binary format. </p>
<p >5.2. All users of the Licensed Software are expressly allowed to change and re-link their own versions of the Qt Toolkit libraries as long as they remain interface-compatible with the libraries originally used to build the Licensed Software. </p>
<p >5.3. Every installation of the Licensed Software contains the "qt_lgpl" folder with the copy of the applicable Qt licenses, as well as the file index.html, which describes how to download, install, and build the Qt Toolkit dynamically linked libraries used by the Licensed Software. </p>
<p >5.4. The "About QM" dialog box of the QM application prominently states that this program uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL. Additionally, the Help menu includes the standard "About Qt" dialog box, which informs the user about the exact version of Qt and explains the Qt licensing terms. Finally, the QM Manual prominently states that this program uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL. </p>

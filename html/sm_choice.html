<div class="textblock"><p >Often in state machines, you need to take a state transition only when a specific condition (called <b>guard condition</b>) evaluates to TRUE at run-time. Also, quite often, you need to transition to different states, depending on the outcome of some guard conditions evaluated at run-time. </p>
<p >The UML provides a special construct, called "choice pseudostate", which you can use in such situations. A "choice pseudostate" allows you to split a transition into multiple outgoing paths, each one with its own <em>guard condition</em>.</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice.png" alt="" class="inline" title="UML Choice pseudostates with one outgoing path (A) and two outgoing paths (B)"/></p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>It is useful to think about the choice pseudostate, such as the one shown in panel (B) of the diagram above, as the compound <code>if (guard1()) {...} else if (guard2()) {...}</code> statement (this is in fact how the <a class="el" href="ce.html">QM&trade; code generator</a> implements choice segments).</dd></dl>
<dl class="section attention"><dt>Attention</dt><dd>Because guards lead to <code>IF</code>s and <code>ELSE</code>s in the code, overusing them leads to "spaghetti" code and defeats the purpose of using state machines in the first place. For that reason guards should be used <b>judiciously</b>.</dd></dl>
<p>In most UML tools, the process of drawing choice segments consists of first adding a "choice pseudostate" (diamond) and then attaching an outgoing transition segment with a guard. In QM&trade; this process is simplified, because the <a class="el" href="sm.html#sm_toolbox">State Machine Toolbox</a> contains ready-to-use <span class="img choice">Choice Segment</span> tool, which combines a "choice pseudostate" with a transition segment attached permanently to it.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd><span class="img choice">Choice Segment</span> is the only way in QM&trade; to attach a <b>guard condition</b> to a transition, as illustrated in panel (A) of the diagram above. But the QM&trade; Choice Segment is more powerful than simple guards on transitions, as explained in the following sections.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_add"></a>
Adding Choice Segment</h1>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>In order to add a choice segment, you first need to <a class="el" href="sm_statechart.html#sm_add">create</a> and <a class="el" href="bm_diagram.html#bm_diagram_open">show</a> a state diagram. Additionally, the state machine must have at least one <a class="el" href="sm_tran.html#sm_tran_intern">internal transition</a> (terminated with <span class="img tran_internal"></span>) or a choice segment (<span class="img tran_choice"></span>). Finally, to add, move, resize, or edit choice segments, the State Machine diagram must be <a class="el" href="bm_lock.html">unlocked</a> (<span class="img unlock"></span>).</dd></dl>
<p>Make sure that the State Machine subwindow is active. In the <a class="el" href="sm.html#sm_toolbox">State Machine Toolbox</a> click on the <span class="img choice">Choice Segment</span> tool and <em>release</em> the mouse button (don't drag the tool off the toolbar). At this point, when you hover the mouse over the active state diagram, the mouse pointer changes to the choice-segment tool with the "forbidden" icon (<span class="img forbidden"></span>), because a choice-segment can only be added to an <span class="highlight">unattached square-end of a transition (<span class="img tran_internal"></span>) or to an existing choice segment (<span class="img tran_choice"></span>)</span>. When you hover the mouse over an allowed attachment point for a choice-segment, the mouse pointer changes to the choice segment tool with the anchor (<span class="img anchor"></span>). To add the choice segment to this attachment point, press the mouse button and drag the choice segment end out to the desired <em>edge</em> of the target state. The transition path thus established will correspond to a regular <b>state-to-state transition</b> with a guard.</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_tran-ani.gif" alt="" class="inline" title="Adding an state-to-state transition Choice Segment"/></p>
<p >You can also add a choice segment that will become an <b>internal transition</b> with a guard. To do this, you simply drag the end of the choice segment and drop it not on any state edge. At this point, the choice-segment will become an <b>internal</b> transition. Internal transition is executed entirely within the source state and never leads to a change of state.</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_int-ani.gif" alt="" class="inline" title="Adding an internal transition Choice Segment"/></p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The standard "normative" UML notation does not allow you to add internal transition segments to choice pseudostates. In contrast, the <a class="el" href="sm_tran.html#sm_tran_intern">non-normative representation of internal transitions</a> in QM&trade; allows you to easily add <b>internal transition segments</b> to choice pseudostates and to quickly and intuitively change the transition type by attaching/detaching the transition end to/from a state.</dd></dl>
<p><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_add-nest"></a>Finally, you can also add a choice segment to an unattached end of another choice segment, as illustrated in the animation below:</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_nest-ani.gif" alt="" class="inline" title="Adding an internal transition Choice Segment"/></p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This option of adding Choice Segments to already existing Choice Segments means that you can build complex <b>nested</b> guards. However, as with all guard conditions, you should use this feature <b>judiciously</b> to avoid "spaghetti" code.</dd></dl>

Choice Segment Property Sheet</h1>
<p ><span class="img choice">Choice Segment</span> item can be configured by the Choice-Specific <a class="el" href="ui_prop.html">Property Sheet</a>.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="sm_choice_prop.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Choice-Segment Property Sheet</div></div>
<p >The Choice Segment property sheet contains the following properties:</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice-guard">Choice Guard</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice-target">Choice Target</a> (not editable&ndash;determined geometrically)</li>
<li><a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice-act">Choice Action</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice-guard"></a>
Choice Guard</h2>
<p >Every choice segment in QM&trade; must have an explicit <b>guard</b> property, which consists of two entries: <em>pseudocode</em> and <em>code</em>. Only the <b>code</b> entry of the <em>guard</em> property is relevant for the <a class="el" href="ce.html">code generation</a>. The <b>pseudocode</b> entry is designed only to be displayed in the diagram to avoid clutter by minimizing the amount of text to display next to the transition shape.</p>
<dl class="section attention"><dt>Attention</dt><dd>The <b>Pseudocode</b> entry of the <em>guard</em> property is intended only for displaying in the the <a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice_text">Text Box</a> associated with the choice segment, but it has <span>no implications for code generation</span>.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The <em>guard</em> property is displayed in the Text Box of the choice segment according to the same rules as the <a class="el" href="sm_tran.html#sm_tran_text">Transition Text Box</a>. Additionally, to reduce the clutter in the diagram, the <em>guard</em> is shown in an <span class="highlight">abbreviated form</span>, where all spaces in the <em>guard</em> are removed and the resulting guard text is truncated at 32 characters. (When the guard is <span class="highlight">truncated</span>, the last character is '<span class="highlight">~</span>').</dd></dl>
<p>For successful code generation, the Code entry of the <em>guard</em> property must be a legal C or C++ Boolean expression. The expression can use the state machine attributes (via the <b>me</b> pointer), and the event parameters of the triggering event (see section below).</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_e-ptr"></a><b>Accessing the Triggering Event:</b> The guard expression can access the original triggering event (of the transition to which the choice is attached directly or indirectly), which is provided as the <b>e</b> pointer of the type <code>(QEvt const * const)</code>. This means that you have <em>read-only</em> access to the event, and you cannot change the <code>e</code> pointer. To access <em>event parameters</em> of the original triggering event, you typically need to <em>downcast</em> the event pointer <b>e</b>. This downcast is always based on the transition <em>trigger</em> (signal of the triggering event, see <a class="el" href="sm_tran.html#sm_tran-trig">Transition Trigger</a>), which means that you must always know the <em>event type</em> (event class) associated with the trigger.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice-target"></a>
Choice Target</h2>
<p >The <b>target</b> property is not editable directly, but rather it is determined geometrically by the end-point of the choice segment. For <em>state-to-state transitions</em>, the <em>target</em> property lists the target state at which the end-point (<span class="img tran_state"></span>) terminates. For <em>internal transitions</em> with the square end-point (<span class="img tran_internal"></span>), the <em>target</em> property shows <code>internal</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice-act"></a>
Choice Action</h2>
<p >A Choice Segment can have optional <b>action</b> property, which is executed only when the <em>guard</em> evaluates to TRUE at runtime (see also <a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice_act">Order of Action Evaluation</a>).</p>
<p >The action property consists of two entries: <em>pseudocode</em> and <em>code</em> (see <a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice_prop">Choice Property Sheet</a>). Only the <b>code</b> part of the <em>action</em> property is relevant for the <a class="el" href="ce.html">code generation</a>. The <b>pseudocode</b> field is designed only to be displayed in the diagram to avoid clutter by minimizing the amount of text to display next to the transition shape.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The <b>Pseudocode</b> entry of the <em>action</em> property is intended only for displaying in the diagram and has <span>no implications for code generation</span>.</dd></dl>
<p><a class="anchor" id="choice_e-par"></a><b>Pointer to the Triggering Event:</b> The choice action <b>code</b> often needs to access the triggering event, which is provided as the <span>e</span> pointer of the type <code>(QEvt const * const)</code>. This means that you have <b>read-only</b> access to the event, and you cannot change the <code>e</code> pointer. To access <em>event parameters</em> of the triggering event, you typically need to <em>downcast</em> the event pointer <b>e</b>. This downcast is always based on the transition <em>trigger</em> (signal of the triggering event, see <a class="el" href="sm_tran.html#sm_tran-trig">Transition Trigger</a>), which means that you must always know the <em>event type</em> (event class) associated with the trigger.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_text"></a>
Choice Text Box</h1>
<p >Once the Choice Segment item is <em>selected</em> as the <a class="el" href="ui_curr_item.html">Current Item</a>, you can see boundary of the <b>Text Box</b> associated with the choice segment. The Text Box allows you to <b>move</b> and <b>resize</b> the choice text by dragging it around or dragging the Text Box Handle according to the same algorithm as the <a class="el" href="sm_tran.html#sm_tran_text">Transition Text Box</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_else"></a>
The else Guard</h1>
<p >The guard property can be defined as the special <b>else</b> keyword. Such <em>else</em> guard complements any other guard conditions attached to the same choice pseudostate. The <em>else</em> guard can be specified either in the code entry or pseudocode entry of the <em>guard</em> property. Obviously, the "else" guard makes sense only for a choice pseudostate with multiple outgoing <span class="img choice">choice segments</span>.</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_else.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Examples of the else guard"/></p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>During the <a class="el" href="ce.html">code generation</a>, the <em>else</em> guard will always be generated last within the group of all guards associated with the same choice pseudostate, regardless of its <a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice_order">order in the Model Explorer</a>.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_none"></a>
Choice Segments Without else</h1>
<p >According to the UML specification, an event that cannot be processed due to all guards evaluating to FALSE must be treated as unprocessed meaning that it must be propagated to the superstate(s). This requirement has implications for choice pseudostates without an explicit <em>else</em> segment. Specifically, to comply with the UML semantics, the <a class="el" href="ce.html">QM&trade; code generator</a> will generate in such cases an implicit <code>else</code> branch that will cause propagation of the event to the superstate(s).</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_empty.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Choice Pseudostates With and Without Explicit else Segment"/></p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>There is a difference between a choice pseudostate with an empty <em>else</em> segment and an otherwise identical choice pseudostate without the <em>else</em> segment. The explicit empty <em>else</em> will cause the event to be consumed (without doing anything), while the absence of the <em>else</em> segment will cause the event to propagate to the superstate(s).</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_order"></a>
Order of Guard Evaluation</h1>
<p >The UML specification requires that the guard conditions attached to the same choice pseudostate be mutually <em>complementary</em>, so that the order of evaluation of the guards does not matter. While keeping the guards complementary is still recommended in QM&trade;, the tool evaluates guards always in the <b>predetermined order</b>, which you can rely on.</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_order.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Multiple Choice Segments With Overlapping Guards"/></p>
<p >The order of guard evaluation is determined by the order of the <span class="img choice">Choice Segment</span> items in the <a class="el" href="ui_explorer.html">Model Explorer</a>. This order can be changed by means of the <span class="img move_up">Up</span> and <span class="img move_down">Down</span> buttons on the Explorer Toolbar. Alternatively, the <a class="el" href="ui_curr_item.html">Current Item</a> can be moved up or down within the Model Explorer by means of the keyboard shortcuts: <b>Ctrl</b>-<span class="img key_up">(key-up)</span> and <b>Ctrl</b>-<span class="img key_down">(key-down)</span>.</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_graph.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Ordered Choice Segments in Model Explorer, Diagram, and Generated Code"/></p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>In case of overlapping guards when the order of guard evaluation matters, it is highly recommended to arrange the Choice Segments graphically in the diagram in same order as in the Model Explorer, as illustrated in the screen shot above. The generated code will then follow the same order, as shown on the right of the diagram above.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_act"></a>
Order of Action Evaluation</h1>
<p >Any choice segments attached to a transition add the choice-segment actions to the action performed by the transition. The order of evaluation of all these actions is intuitive and starts always with the transition action executed unconditionally, followed by the conditional evaluation of choice-segment actions.</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_actions.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Transition Actions and Choice Actions"/></p>
<p >For example, the order of action evaluation in the diagram above is summarized by the following pseudocode:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">. . .</div>
<div class="line">case TRIG: {</div>
<div class="line">    <span class="comment">/* transition action... */</span></div>
<div class="line">    action0(); <span class="comment">/* executed unconditionally */</span></div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    <span class="comment">/* choice segments... */</span></div>
<div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (g1()) {</div>
<div class="line">        action1();</div>
<div class="line">        . . .</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">else</span> <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (g2()) {</div>
<div class="line">        action2();</div>
<div class="line">        . . .</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">else</span> {</div>
<div class="line">        . . .</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
<div class="line">. . .</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_nest"></a>
Nested Choice Segments</h1>
<p >As described <a class="el" href="sm_choice.html#sm_choice_add-nest">above</a>, Choice Segments can <b>nest</b>. This allows you to build complex conditional transition paths, but as always with guards, the feature should <em>not</em> be overused.</p>
<p >For example, one common mistake is to use deeply nested choice segments to choose among a number of possible transition paths (see panel (A) in the diagram below):</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_nest.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Deeply Nested Choice Segments (A) vs. Muliple Choice Segments (B)"/></p>
<p >A better and much simpler alternative is to use multiple choice segments attached to the <b>same</b> choice pseudostate, as shown in panel (B) in the diagram above.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Remember that you can attach many choice segments to a given transition. A diagram with smaller number of choice pseudostates (diamonds <span class="img tran_choice"></span>) is a better, easier to understand diagram.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section attention"><dt>Attention</dt><dd>The <a class="el" href="ce.html">QM&trade; code generator</a> limits the number of nesting levels in the code to 16 (including the nesting inside state-handler functions). The use of deeply-nested Choice Segments can easily exceed this limit.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sm_choice_routing"></a>
Routing Choice Segments</h1>
<p >A transition with multiple choice segments, some of them potentially nested, groups many elements in a small diagram space. To graphically re-arrange such a complex "ball of connectors", you need to be aware of the basic rules that apply in this situation.</p>
<p >The first rule is that before you can change the shape of any element, you first need to <b>select</b> it.</p>
<p >For example, if you want to move the choice-pseuodstate (the diamond <span class="img tran_choice"></span>), you need to click on the original incoming transition to the choice-pseudostate. Pleease note that you quite specifically should <em>not</em> click on the diamond shape itself, because it is actually an overlapped collection of the incoming transion-end plus all the outgoing choce segments, so it is ambiguous which shape you actually mean. Instead, you shouild click on one of the transition segments or the begin-end of the transiton. (<b>NOTE:</b> You can also unambiguously select any model item in the <a class="el" href="ui_explorer.html">Model Explorer</a> view). The following animation illustrates the process:</p>
<p ><img src="sm_choice_move-ani.gif" alt="" class="inline" title="Moving the choice-pseudostates (the diamonds)"/></p>
<p >On the other hand, if you select an outgoing choice-segment, you cannot move the choice-pseudostate. Instead, you can now move just the selected choice-segment to re-attach it somewhere else.</p>
